# Hey there! I'm Nick Henley

I'm a graduate from **The University of Colorado Boulder**. I’m passionate about technology, particularly **AI** and **cybersecurity**, and I’m currently on the lookout for professional opportunities to dive into. Feel free to reach out to me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nhenley/)!

## What I'm working on
I've started a project called [Quantlytic](https://github.com/Quantlytic) to brush up on CI/CD, microservice architecture, and consuming API's. Check it out!

## Past Projects
I’ve had the privilege of working on some exciting projects, both with **Blueprint Boulder**, a student organization focused on building impactful solutions, and through my senior capstone. Here’s what I’ve done:

- **Team Member**: Contributed to [Foster Source](https://github.com/Blueprint-Boulder/f21s22-foster-source) – Built a TypeScript web application to connect foster parents in the local area, enabling them to provide each other with childcare support.
- **Team Lead**: Led [Portland Indigenous Marketplace](https://github.com/Blueprint-Boulder/f23-PortlandIndigenousMarketplace) – Developed a mobile web app to help the organization manage art vendors and art fairs.
- **Senior Capstone**: Working with a team sponsored by [BI Incorporated](https://github.com/tjather/BI-Incorporated-Senior-Desgin) – Testing the viability of Non-Terrestrial Networks for IoT applications.

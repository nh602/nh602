# Hey there! I'm Nick Henley

I'm a student at **The University of Colorado Boulder**, set to graduate in **May 2025**. I’m passionate about technology, particularly in the realms of **AI** and **cybersecurity**, and I’m currently on the lookout for opportunities to dive into these fields professionally.

## What I’ve Been Up To
I’ve had the privilege of working on some exciting projects, both with **Blueprint Boulder**, a student organization focused on building impactful solutions, and through my senior capstone. Here’s what I’ve done:

- **Team Member**: Contributed to [Foster Source](https://github.com/Blueprint-Boulder/f21s22-foster-source) – Built a TypeScript web application to connect foster parents in the local area, enabling them to provide each other with childcare support.
- **Team Lead**: Led [Portland Indigenous Marketplace](https://github.com/Blueprint-Boulder/f23-PortlandIndigenousMarketplace) – Developed a mobile web app to help the organization manage art vendors and art fairs.
- **Senior Capstone**: Working with a team sponsored by [BI Incorporated](https://github.com/tjather/BI-Incorporated-Senior-Desgin) – Testing the viability of Non-Terrestrial Networks for IoT applications.

Check out the repos linked above to see what we’ve built!

## When I’m Not Coding
In my free time, I love to:
- **Read** – a chance to disconnect and step away from screens with a good book.
- **Hike & Ski** – hitting the trails or slopes keeps me active and inspired.
- **Unwind** – relaxing with video games or a solid TV series is my go-to downtime.
